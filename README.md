# System-and-Methods-for-Big-and-Unstructured-Data
## Project 2022-2023

The goal of the project is to perform data and architecture design of a given case study, Bibliography Database, starting from the specification of the problem to data queries in Neo4j,MongoDB and PySpark.
The project was divided in 3 deliveries and a final presentation.

- **MySQL** : from problem specification and assumptions to ER schema.
- **Neo4j** : from data upload to data queries ( creation, update, aggregations, minimum path, conditions... ) with explanations and complexity / performance time check.
- **MongoDB** : from the design of the structure of the dataset and data upload and transformation to data queries (creation, upload, multiple filtering conditions, aggregations, unwind, joins, ...) with explanations and complexity / performance time check.
- **PySpark** : from the design of the structure of the dataset and data upload to data queries (creation, update, join, nested query, group by, ...) with explanations.
